**Design a clean and functional footer for my developer portfolio. The footer should act as a consistent navigation anchor on every page. Key elements to include:**

- **Left Section:** A simple, bold version of my name ("Messaoudi B." or "Belkacem") or a small monogram/logo, acting as a quick link back to the homepage.

- **Center Section (Navigation Links):** A concise horizontal list of primary site sections: **Home, About, Projects, Contact**. These should be clickable and have a subtle hover effect.

- **Right Section (Social Links):** Visually consistent icons for my three key professional platforms: **Email, GitHub, LinkedIn**. Each icon should open the respective link in a new tab.

- **Bottom Bar:** A thin, separated bar containing:
    1.  A short copyright notice: "© [Current Year] Messaoudi Belkacem. All rights reserved."
    2.  A subtle, small-text note on the right: "Built with [Coffee/Passion] & [React/Next.js/your tech]."

**Overall Aesthetic:** The footer should be minimal, with subtle background contrast, fine dividers, and excellent spacing. It must feel lightweight, non-intrusive, and fully responsive, collapsing elegantly on mobile (stacking the center and right sections vertically). Typography and colors must match the site's main design system.
