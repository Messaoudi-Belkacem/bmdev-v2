**Design a contact section for my developer portfolio. The goal is to make it simple, professional, and frictionless for recruiters or clients to reach me. Use a clean, two-column layout with inviting messaging. The primary elements must be:**

- **Left Column:** Eye-catching headline "Let's Build the Next Intelligent Interface", a short inviting message, and prominent clickable icons for Email, LinkedIn, and GitHub with clear labels.
- **Right Column:** A minimal embedded contact form with fields for Name, Email, Subject (with dropdown options: Freelance Project, Job Opportunity, Collaboration, Other), and Message. Include a polished "Send Message" button.
- **Subtle Elements:** A small note on response time and my location/timezone (Batna, Algeria, CET). Ensure the overall aesthetic aligns with a modern tech portfolio.

**Keep it visually balanced, mobile-responsive, and focused on usability.**
